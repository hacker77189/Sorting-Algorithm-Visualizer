## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to:

- Strengthen my frontend development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Provide an educational tool for beginners to **learn**, **observe**, and **understand** how sorting algorithms work through **real-time visualizations**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Intuitive and responsive UI.
- Real-time animations for each sorting process.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed.
- Color-coded bars representing array elements for better visual clarity.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included:

1. ðŸ«§ **Bubble Sort**
2. ðŸ§© **Insertion Sort**
3. ðŸ§® **Selection Sort**
4. ðŸ”€ **Merge Sort**
5. âš¡ **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm displays a step-by-step transformation of the array until it is fully sorted.
