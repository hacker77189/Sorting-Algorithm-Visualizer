# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to visualize popular sorting algorithms in action. This interactive tool demonstrates how classic sorting techniques operate step-by-step, making it ideal for learners and developers alike.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:

- Strengthen my frontend development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Provide an educational tool for beginners to **learn**, **observe**, and **understand** how sorting algorithms work through **real-time visualizations**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Intuitive and responsive UI.
- Real-time animations for each sorting process.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed.
- Color-coded bars representing array elements for better visual clarity.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included:

1. 🫧 **Bubble Sort**
2. 🧩 **Insertion Sort**
3. 🧮 **Selection Sort**
4. 🔀 **Merge Sort**
5. ⚡ **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm displays a step-by-step transformation of the array until it is fully sorted.

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

You can include screenshots or GIFs of the visualizer in action to showcase the UI and functionality.
